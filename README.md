# key-workers
For research on 'key workers' from Covid-19 lockdown

This contains versions of macros in Stata format that are designed to generate 'key worker' measures based on 
codes in occupational and industry taxonomies. 

The macros are likely to be subject to updates through time. 

Created as part of research into 'key workers' as a category, with an interest in social inequalities that key 
workers might experience and in social policies that might be targetted at supporting key workers.
